/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where all
 * user-generated data is stored in a private data tree. Access is determined by
 * the path structure, ensuring a user can only ever access documents that exist
 * under their own unique user ID. This approach eliminates the need for complex
 * lookups (get() calls) in rules, resulting in a highly secure, performant, and
 * easy-to-maintain system.
 *
 * Data Structure: All data is nested hierarchically under the top-level `/users`
 * collection. The structure follows the pattern: /users/{userId}/{subcollection}/{docId}.
 * This ensures that every piece of data has a clear and explicit owner based on
 * the `{userId}` in its path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration Blocked: Listing the top-level `/users` collection is
 *   explicitly forbidden to prevent attackers from discovering the full list of
 *   application users.
 * - Strict Path-Based Ownership: A user's authenticated UID must match the
 *   `{userId}` wildcard in the document path for any access to be granted.
 * - Relational Integrity: For the core user profile document, the internal `id`
 *   field must match the document ID (`userId`) on creation and remain immutable
 *   afterward, ensuring a permanent link between the document and its owner.
 * - Default Deny: All operations are denied by default unless explicitly permitted
 *   by a rule.
